# My First Website Using React 😄

## ***Introduction To The Project*** 📢

**This web site is the first website I developed using React (primarily), Javascript, HTML, CSS.**

**I developed this as means for practicing the skills and technology that I learnt while going through my web development course.**

**It is a very basic website.**

**All it does is _Display a List of the Users Database_ with a profile picture (in this case, a robot avatar) in the _form of Cards_.**

**There is also a _Search Bar_ function to _Search through the List of Users_ based on their Names.**

**Do Star ⭐ this repo if you liked it 🙃**

## **Snapshot of the website:-** 🤓
